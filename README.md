# Odin Project - Google Homepage

## Project Description:
For this project I'll be trying to replicate the Google homepage in aesthetics, not in function.

## Priorities:
1. x Link logo 
2. x Create search bar
3. x Center logo and search bar
4. x Create 'Google Search' and 'Feeling Lucky' buttons underneath
5. x 'Google offered in: Deutsch' underneath that
6. x Create navbar at top with: About, Store (left), Gmail, Images, blocks, profile pic (right)
7. x Round edges of search bar
8. x Elongate search bar
9. x Align nav bar contents left and right respectively
10. x Vertically align squares in navbar
11. x Style buttons correctly
12. x Add footer with: Germany (top), Advertising, Business, How Search Works (left), Privacy, Terms, Settings (right)
13. Add hover functions for buttons
14. Add search (left) and voice search (right) icons

## Post-Mortem Notes
During the project, the main thing I struggled with was properly aligning the left and right sides of the navigation bar. It was frustrating enough that I took a break from the project and did other projects. Coming back to it was easier, [but ultimately used a solution from this article] (https://freshman.tech/flexbox-navbar/). 

I ended up not doing hover functions nor the search and voice search icons, partially because the project description says not to, and mostly because I wanted to move on to a different project, and was getting diminishing returns from obsessively styling this.
