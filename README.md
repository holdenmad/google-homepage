    x 'Google offered in: Deutsch' underneath that
    x Create navbar at top with: About, Store (left), Gmail, Images, blocks, profile pic (right)
    x Round edges of search bar
    x Elongate search bar
    x Align nav bar contents left and right respectively
    Vertically align squares in navbar
    Style buttons correctly
    Add footer with: Germany (top), Advertising, Business, How Search Works (left), Privacy, Terms, Settings (right)
    Add hover functions for buttons
    Add search (left) and voice search (right) icons
